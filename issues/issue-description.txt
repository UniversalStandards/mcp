### Error Description

**File:** .github/workflows/auto-review.yml  
**Ref:** a60a283f5928c9b8ba1bb12e90837cf745f0ae30  

**Error Message:** Failing workflow due to 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading createComment)'.  

**Cause:** The error occurs because the github object is not passed properly in actions/github-script.  

**Solution:** Update the script block to use the function form `async ({github, context}) => { ... }` so that github and context are correctly provided as arguments. Also, ensure the github-token is set as required by actions/github-script.
